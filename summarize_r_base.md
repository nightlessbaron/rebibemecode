# R_base Repository Summary: Gymnasium

## Overview
R_base is the **Gymnasium** repository (https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium), which is a fork and continuation of OpenAI's Gym library. It provides a standard API for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Key Information
- **Repository**: Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium
- **Purpose**: Standard API for reinforcement learning environments
- **Python Version**: 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 (Linux and macOS)
- **License**: MIT License
- **Maintainer**: Farama Foundation

## Core Dependencies
- `numpy >=1.21.0`
- `cloudpickle >=1.2.0`
- `typing-extensions >=4.3.0`
- `farama-notifications >=0.0.1`

## Environment Families
1. **Classic Control** - Classic RL problems based on real-world physics
2. **Box2D** - Physics-based toy games using Box2D and PyGame
3. **Toy Text** - Simple environments with small discrete state/action spaces
4. **MuJoCo** - Complex multi-joint control physics environments
5. **Atari** - Atari 2600 ROM emulation with high complexity
6. **Third-party** - Community-created environments compatible with Gymnasium API

## Installation Options
- Base: `pip install gymnasium`
- Specific families: `pip install "gymnasium[atari]"`
- All dependencies: `pip install "gymnasium[all]"`

## API Structure
The library provides a simple Python `env` class interface:
```python
import gymnasium as gym
env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")
observation, info = env.reset(seed=42)
action = env.action_space.sample()
observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
```

## Key Features
- Standardized environment interface
- Environment versioning (e.g., "-v0", "-v1")
- Extensive testing and CI/CD
- Comprehensive documentation
- Multi-platform support
- Integration with popular RL libraries (CleanRL, PettingZoo)

## Repository Structure
- `gymnasium/` - Main package directory
- `tests/` - Comprehensive test suite
- `docs/` - Documentation and assets
- `setup.py` - Package setup configuration
- `pyproject.toml` - Modern Python packaging configuration

## Integration Considerations
This repository serves as the base environment for RL development. The R_old repository (multi_car_racing) needs to be integrated as a new environment family that follows Gymnasium's API standards and can be registered with the environment registry.
